## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- CSS Modules
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - Component Library
- [Redux-React](https://react-redux.js.org/) - State management

### What I learned

I learned alot about MUI,Redux,React and working with the API. MUI made it alot easier to make the components
and style them while redux helped alot with state management. The API on the other hand was a pain to work with
since the data is not formatted correctly i should have just used the data provided as that one is much easier 
to work with. 

### Continued development

I want to get better at MUI to be able to make applications faster instead of custom CSS

### Useful resources

- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - Component Library
- [Redux-React](https://react-redux.js.org/) - State management
